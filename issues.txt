Since this repo does not have Issues, I had to create a PR to ask a question.

I was trying this (in console and Rails initializers)

```ruby
Emoji.create("custom_emoji") do |char|
  char.add_alias "jenkins_success"
  char.image_filename = "integrations/jenkins/jenkins_icon_success_2x.png"
end
```

It throws the error:
`NoMethodError: undefined method `image_filename=' for #<Emoji::Character:custom_emoji>`

But the documentation says one can use this.
Any help?

version: 2.1.0
